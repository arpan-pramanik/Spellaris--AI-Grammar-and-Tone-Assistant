### 4. Rewrite in 6 Different Tones
One of Spellaris's most powerful features is the ability to rewrite any text in six distinct tones:

- **Professional** - Clear, respectful, and suited for workplace communication
- **Casual** - Relaxed and conversational, ideal for everyday messaging
- **Formal** - Structured and polite, appropriate for academic or official use
- **Creative** - Expressive and imaginative, perfect for storytelling or content writing
- **Assertive** - Confident and direct, great for persuasive or leadership communication
- **Friendly** - Warm and approachable, suitable for informal or supportive conversations

This allows you to adapt your writing style instantly to suit any situation or platform.
